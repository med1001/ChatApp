## How to Build
1. Ensure GCC is installed on your system.
2. Run `make` to build the server binary.
3. The compiled binary will be located in the `build/` directory.

## How to Clean
Run `make clean` to remove all build artifacts.

## Next Steps
Start implementing the server functionality in `src/server.c` and define its interface in `include/server.h`.
